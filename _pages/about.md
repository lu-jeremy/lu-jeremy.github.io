I am a third-year undergraduate student at Purdue University pursuing dual honors degrees in 
Computer Science and Statistics (expected 2026).
I recently interned as a **Software Development Engineer** at **Amazon AGI** in Sunnyvale, CA,
and currently conduct research at [CoRAL Lab](https://corallab.net/) under the supervision of Professor [Ahmed Qureshi](https://qureshiahmed.github.io/).

My research focuses on constructing intelligent systems that learn 
abstract representations of the world through probabilistic frameworks,
with emphasis on statistical machine learning, Bayesian methods,
variational inference,
and theoretically-grounded generative models.
